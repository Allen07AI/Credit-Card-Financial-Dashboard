# Credit-Card-Financial-Dashboard

Problem Statement:
The project aimed to analyze credit card customer and transaction data to provide actionable insights and enhance decision-making. With a dataset comprising over 10,000 customers, the goal was to develop an interactive dashboard that would enable real-time analysis and reporting of key metrics related to customer behavior and transaction trends.

Approach:
To achieve this, we developed an interactive dashboard featuring two detailed reports using customer and transaction data extracted from an SQL database. Data transformation tasks were executed using Power Query, and DAX queries were employed to create new variables for revenue calculation and to segment customers by age and income, optimizing the data processing workflow.

The dashboard tracked and analyzed over seven key performance metrics, including total revenue, interest rates, and revolving balances. This comprehensive analysis provided stakeholders with valuable insights and recommendations for data-driven decision-making, enhancing their ability to understand customer behavior and transaction patterns.

Conclusion:
This project successfully delivered an interactive dashboard that offered real-time insights into credit card customer and transaction data. By leveraging advanced data transformation techniques and key performance metrics, the dashboard facilitated informed decision-making and strategic planning, proving essential for understanding and optimizing credit card business operations.
